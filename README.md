This is a clone of KBC gane in c language using file handling.
Here this is project in which we used file handling concept to store questions and aslo we used random function to get only one question at a time on your window.Then we have two files like ans.c and opt.c file for getting correct answer and correct option for that perticular answer. If answer given by player is match with our correct answer then player allow to face a next question otherwise he/she will be out of game.Player can face maximum 10 question.If he/she will able to do all correct answer of 10 question then he/she will be winner.

Note:- first confirm your capslock is on while playing this game
